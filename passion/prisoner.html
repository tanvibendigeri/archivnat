		<p><center id = "body-f" style = "font-size: 20px;"><b>(TW: Substance Abuse)</b> This song is about being in Hollywood and the burdens and pressures that come with it. It&apos;s about &#8220;want[ing] it all&#8221; while also knowing that it&apos;s destroying your psyche. Lana and The Weeknd have collaborated several times but this is definitely my favorite. Both of them have gone through substance abuse issues, heightened by the nature of the industry. This song draws inspiration from that. It&apos;s heartbreaking and gritty, without being highly graphic or explicit.</center></p>

		<b>[Verse 1 - The Weeknd]<br>
		You bring good to my lonely life, honestly (Honestly)<br>
		It&apos;s hard for me to look into your eyes<br>
		When I say (I say) that I would be nothing without your love (&apos;Out your love)<br>
		I feel the rush and it&apos;s amazing<br><br>

		[Pre-Chorus - The Weeknd]<br>
		Maybe I&apos;ve been always destined to end up in this place (Up in this place), yeah<br>
		I don&apos;t mean to come off selfish, but I want it all (I want it all)<br>
		Love will always be a lesson, let&apos;s get out of its way (Out of its way)<br>
		&apos;Cause I know (Ooh, yeah), all I know (Ooh, yeah), all I know (Ooh, yeah)<br><br>

		[Chorus - The Weeknd & Lana Del Rey]<br>
		I&apos;m a prisoner to my addiction<br>
		I&apos;m addicted to a life that&apos;s so empty and so cold<br>
		I&apos;m a prisoner to my decisions<br>
		Woooo, woooo, woooo<br><br>

		[Verse 2 - Lana Del Rey]<br>
		(Ah-ah)<br>
		I think I&apos;ve been in Hollywood for too long (For too long)<br>
		&apos;Cause I can feel my soul burning, feel it burning slow<br>
		But I would be nothing without the touch (Out the touch)<br>
		I feel the rush and it&apos;s amazing, hmm<br><br>

		[Pre-Chorus - Lana Del Rey]<br><br>

		[Chorus - The Weeknd & Lana Del Rey x2]<br><br>


		[Outro - Lana Del Rey]<br>
		I don&apos;t know<br>
		I get so wrapped up in a world where nothing&apos;s as it seems<br>
		And real life is stranger than my dreams</b>
