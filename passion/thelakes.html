		<h1>the lakes - Taylor Swift</h1>
		<p>Taylor Swift&apos;s songwriting shines in this song. It&apos;s in spite of everyone who has said that she writes one-dimensional break-up songs. &#8220;I&apos;ve come too far to watch some name-dropping sleaze, tell me what are my words worth.&#8221; (Which by the way, this line is an epic reference to the poet William Wordsworth) The entire <i>folklore</i> album is about stories that she&apos;s created while drawing from her own life and this song is no exception. This song is about a character wanting to run away from the public eye to somewhere where she can be alone with the one she loves. She expresses that she isn&apos;t made for this life and that she wants to live as the poets did: sad and lonely by the Lakes.<br><br> 

		<b>[Verse 1]<br>
		Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?<br>
		I&apos;m not cut out for all these cynical clones<br>
		These hunters with cell phones<br><br>

		[Chorus]<br>
		Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die<br>
		I don&apos;t belong and my beloved, neither do you<br>
		Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry<br>
		I'm setting off, but not without my muse<br><br>

		[Verse 2]<br>
		What should be over burrowed under my skin<br>
		In heart-stopping waves of hurt<br>
		I&apos;ve come too far to watch some name-dropping sleaze<br>
		Tell me what are my words worth<br><br>


		[Chorus]<br><br>


		[Bridge]<br>
		I want auroras and sad prose<br>
		I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet<br>
		&apos;Cause I haven't moved in years<br>
		And I want you right here<br>
		A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground<br>
		With no one around to tweet it<br>
		While I bathe in cliffside pools<br>
		With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief<br><br>


		[Chorus]<br>
		No, not without you</b>
