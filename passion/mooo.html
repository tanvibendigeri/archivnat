		<b><center id = "title-e" style = "font-size: 80px;">MOOO! - Doja Cat</center></b>
		<p><center id = "body-e" style = "font-size: 20px;">Right now you might be wondering why this song has been included in this list and if I am insane. To you I say one thing: this song is absolutely genius. In an interview, Doja Cat mentioned that she wanted to create a &#8220;meme song&#8221; that would go viral for no other reason than that fact that it was stupid and funny. And yes, while at first this song seems like just that, it&apos;s extremely intelligently written. I believe that there is a certain nuance when it comes to writing silly, lighthearted things that is very difficult to achieve. Every line of this song is a play on words or reference to nursery rhymes and pop music, all relating back to cows and farms. It&apos;s fun, it&apos;s witty, and it&apos;s a little bonkers.</center></p>
