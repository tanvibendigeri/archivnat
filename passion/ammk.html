		<b><center id = "title-b" style = "font-size: 80px;">Abhi Mujh Mein Kahin - Sonu Nigam</center></b>
		<p><center id = "body-b" style = "font-size: 20px;">I grew up listening to this song, hearing my father sing it and playing it in the car on road trips, but as I got older, I finally began to understand what the words meant. It&apos;s about hope&#8212; about being at rock bottom and realizing that there is still life in you somewhere. It&apos;s euphoric, it&apos;s bittersweet. This feeling is amplified by the springy, hopeful string sections during the interludes. A lot of Indian music tends to have long intervals of music, but it&apos;s often repetitive and not very interesting. This song sets itself apart. I had the privilege of hearing it live a few weeks ago.</center></p>

		<b>[Verse 1] <br>Abhi mujh mein kahin <br>
		Baaki thodi si hai zindagi <br>
		Jagi dhadkan nayi <br>
		Jaana zinda hoon main to abhi <br>
		Kuch aisi lagan <br>
		Is lamhe mein hai <br>
		Yeh lamha kahaan tha mera</b> <br><br>

		There is still a little bit of life inside of me<br>
		A new heartbeat arose in me<br>
		And I realized that I am still alive<br>
		I have so much tenacity in this moment<br>
		Where was it before? <br><br> 

		<b>[Chorus]<br>

		Ab hai saamne, ise chhoo loon zara<br>
		Mar jaaun ya jee loon zara<br>
		Khushiyaan choom loon<br>
		Ya ro loon zara<br>
		Mar jaaun ya jee loon zara<br><br>
		Ho abhi mujh mein kahin <br>
		Baaki thodi si hai zindagi</b><br><br>

		Now it&apos;s in front of me<br>
		So close I can touch it<br> 
		Should I die, or should I live a little<br>
		Should I embrace joy<br>
		Or should I cry a little<br>
		Should I die, or should I live a little<br><br>
		There is still a little bit of life inside of me<br><br>

		<b>[Verse 2]<br>
		Ho dhoop mein jalte hue tann ko<br>
		chhaya ped ki mil gayi<br>
		Roothe bachche ki hasi jaise<br>
		Phuslaane se phir khil gayi<br>
		Kuch aisa hi ab mehsoos dil ko ho raha hai<br>
		Barson ke purane zakhmon pe marham laga sa hai<br>
		Kuch aisa reham is lamhe mein hai<br>
		Ye lamha kahaan tha mera</b><br><br>

		Like someone burning under the sun <br>
		Finding shade under a tree<br>
		Like when an upset child smiles<br>
		After being coaxed<br>
		That&apos;s how my heart feels now<br>
		Like medicine on a years-old wound<br>
		Such mercy is in this moment<br>
		Where was it before?<br><br>

		<b>[Chorus]<br><br>

		[Verse 3]<br>
		Dor se tooti patang jaisi<br>
		thi yeh zindagani meri<br>
		Aaj hoon kal ho mera na ho<br>
		Har din thi kahaani meri<br>
		Ek bandhan naya peechhe se ab mujhko bulaaye
		<br>Aane wale kal ki kyun fikar mujhko sataa jaaye<br>
		Ek aisi chubhan, is lamhe mein hai<br>
		Yeh lamha kahaan tha mera</b> <br><br>

		My life was like<br>
		A kite with a broken string<br>
		Today I&apos;m here, whether or not I&apos;ll be here tomorrow <br>
		Every day I lived was part of my story<br>
		Now a new bond is calling me back<br>
		Why is this worry for tomorrow bothering me?<br>
		There is such a gnawing feeling in this moment<br>
		Where was it before?<br><br>
		
		<b>[Chorus]</b>
