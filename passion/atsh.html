		<b><center id = "title-c" style = "font-size: 80px;">Agar Tum Saath Ho - Alka Yagnik, Arijit Singh</center></b>
		<p><center id = "body-c" style = "font-size: 20px;">Agar Tum Saath Ho is a stunning duet between a man and woman whose relationship is on the edge of breaking. It perfectly captures the duality of their situation. She is saying that everything in her life is better when she&apos;s around him. However, he doesn&apos;t see a point to their relationship because she believes he&apos;s someone he&apos;s not and that his life is painful either way. It&apos;s her desperate attempt at getting him to stay and his final plea to get her to let him go. It&apos;s beautiful storytelling that is full of intense emotion.</center></p>

		<b>[Verse 1 - Alka Yagnik]<br>
		Pal bhar theher jao<br>
		Dil ye sambhal jaaye<br>
		Kaise tumhe roka karoon<br><br></b>

		Stay for just a moment<br>
		Let my heart steady itself<br>
		How can I keep stopping you?<br><br>

		<b>[Pre-Chorus - Alka Yagnik]<br>
		Meri taraf aata<br>
		Har gham phisal jaaye<br>
		Aankhon mein tumko bharoon<br>
		Bin bole baatein tumse karoon<br>
		Agar tum saath ho<br>
		Agar tum saath ho<br><br></b>

		Every sorrow coming towards me<br>
		Would slip away<br>
		I&apos;ll fill my eyes with you<br>
		I&apos;ll talk to you without speaking<br>
		If you are with me<br>
		If you are with me<br><br>

		<b>[Verse 2 - Alka Yagnik]<br>
		Behti rehti neher nadiyaan si teri duniya mein<br>
		Meri duniya hai teri chaahaton mein<br>
		Main dhal jaati hoon teri aadaton mein<br>
		Agar tum saath ho<br><br></b>

		In your world, everything flows like a river<br>
		My world is in your love<br>
		I&apos;ll go with whatever you do<br>
		If you are with me<br><br>

		<b>[Male Chorus - Arijit Singh]<br>
		Teri nazron mein hai tere sapne<br>
		Tere sapnon mein hai naraazi<br>
		Mujhe lagta hai ki baatein dil ki<br>
		Hoti lafzon ki dhokhebaazi<br>
		Tum saath ho ya na ho<br>
		Kya fark hai<br>
		Bedard thi zindagi bedard hai<br>
		Agar tum saath ho<br>
		Agar tum saath ho<br><br></b>

		Your eyes carry your dreams<br>
		Your dreams carry anger<br>
		I think that talks of the heart<br>
		Are all deception<br>
		Whether you&apos;re with me or not<br>
		What difference is there?<br>
		Life was painful, and it continues to be<br>
		If you are with me<br>
		If you are with me<br><br>

		<b>[Verse 3 - Alka Yagnik]<br>
		Palkein jhapakte hai<br>
		Din ye nikal jaaye<br>
		Baithi baithi bhaagi phiroon<br><br></b>

		My eyelashes flutter once<br>
		And the day runs out<br>
		I&apos;m running around while sitting down<br><br>

		<b>[Chorus]<br><br>

		[Male Chorus]<br><br>

		[Outro - Alka Yagnik and Arijit Singh]<br>
		Agar tum saath ho<br>
		Dil ye sambhal jaaye<br>
		Agar tum saath ho<br>
		Har gham phisal jaaye<br>
		Agar tum saath ho<br>
		Din ye nikal jaaye<br>
		Agar tum saath ho<br>
		Har gham phisal jaaye<br><br></b>

		If you are with me<br>
		My heart steadies itself<br>
		If you are with me<br>
		Every sorrow slips away<br>
		If you are with me<br>
		The day runs out<br>
		If you are with me<br>
		Every sorrow slips away<br>
