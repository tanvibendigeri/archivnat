		<b><center id = "title-d" style = "font-size: 80px;">Bubblegum Bitch - MARINA</center></b>
		<p><center id = "body-d" style = "font-size: 20px;">I only realized a few years ago that this song is meant to be ironic. It&apos;s about how intense emotions are when you are a teenager, and how we feel like we have to conform to a certain list of characteristics in order to be liked by other people. In the song, she describes herself as having the &#8220;perfect&#8221; body and says that she doesn&apos;t care if people think she&apos;s dumb, while also pushing the &#8220;Hell is a teenage girl&#8221; narrative. &#8220;I&apos;ll chew you up and spit you out, &apos;cause that&apos;s what young love is all about,&#8221; she cleverly talks about how society teaches you to have certain expectations for how love should be, especially when you&apos;re young. Satire can be difficult to pull off, but Marina does it amazingly here.</center></p>

		<b>[Verse 1]<br>
		Got a figure like a pinup<br>
		Got a figure like a doll<br>
		Don&apos;t care if you think I&apos;m dumb<br>
		I don&apos;t care at all<br>
		Candy bear, sweetie pie, wanna be adored<br>
		I&apos;m the girl you&apos;d die for<br>
		I&apos;ll chew you up and I&apos;ll spit you out<br>
		&apos;Cause that&apos;s what young love is all about<br>
		So pull me closer, and kiss me hard<br>
		I&apos;m gonna pop your bubblegum heart<br><br>

		[Chorus]<br>
		I&apos;m Miss Sugar Pink Liquor-Liquor Lips<br>
		Hit me with your sweet love, steal me with a kiss<br>
		I&apos;m Miss Sugar Pink Liquor-Liquor Lips<br>
		I&apos;m gonna be your bubblegum bitch<br>
		I&apos;m gonna be your bubblegum bitch<br><br>

		[Verse 2]<br>
		Queentex, latex, I&apos;m your wonder maid<br>
		Life gave me some lemons so I made some lemonade<br>
		Soda pop, soda pop, baby, here I come<br>
		Straight to number one<br>
		Oh, dear diary, I met a boy<br>
		He made my doll heart light up with joy<br>
		Oh, dear diary, we fell apart<br>
		Welcome to the life of Electra Heart<br><br>

		[Chorus]<br><br>

		[Bridge]<br>
		I think I want ya&#8212; your American tan<br>
		I think you&apos;re gonna be my biggest fan<br><br>

		[Chorus x2]</b>
