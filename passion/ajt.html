		<p><center id = "body-a" style = "font-size: 20px;">I used to sing this song to my little brother as a lullaby when he was young. It&apos;s about how the return of a long-lost lover will feel like the start of spring; the flowers will finally bloom, the rains will burst forth from the heavens. In the movie that this song is from, <i>Jab We Met</i>, the main protagonist lets go of the girl he loves so that she can marry the man she loves, and this song plays when he finally sees her again. My personal favorite line from this song is: &#8220;<i>Palkon pe jhil mil taare hai,</i>&#8221; which translates to &#8220;There are shining stars on your eyelashes.&#8221; But there aren&apos;t really stars on her lashes, there are tears. It&apos;s truly gorgeous imagery.</center></p>

		<b>[Chorus]<br>
		Aaoge jab tum o saajna<br>
		Aaoge jab tum o saajna<br>
		Anganaa phool khilenge<br>
		Barsega saawan, barsega saawan<br>
		Jhoom jhoom ke<br>
		Do dil aise milenge<br><br></b>

		When you come back, my dear<br>
		When you come back, my dear<br>
		The flowers in the garden will bloom again<br>
		Our hearts will finally reunite<br>
		Like the fall of heavy rain<br><br>

		<b>[Verse 1]<br>
		Naina tere kajrare hai<br>
		Naino pe hum dil harein hai<br>
		Anjane hi tere naino ne<br>
		Vaade kiye kayi saare hai<br>
		Saanson ki laiy madham chale<br>
		Tose gaye, barsega saawan<br>
		Barsega saawan jhoom jhoom ke<br>
		Do dil aise milenge<br><br></b>

		Your eyes are lined with kohl<br>
		I have lost my heart to your eyes<br>
		You said nothing, but your gaze<br>
		Promised me the world<br>
		Breathing has become so difficult<br>
		Ever since you left<br>
		Our hearts will finally reunite<br>
		Like the fall of heavy rain<br><br>

		<b>[Chorus]<br><br>

		[Verse 2]<br>
		Chanda ko taaku raaton mein<br>
		Hai zindagi tere hathon mein<br>
		Palkon pe jhil mil taare hai<br>
		Aana bhari barsato mein<br>
		Sapno ka jahaan<br>
		Hoga khila-khila<br>
		Barsega saawan, barsega saawan<br>
		Jhoom jhoom ke<br>
		Do dil aise milenge<br><br></b>

		I stare at the moon every night<br>
		My life is in your hands<br>
		There are shining stars on your eyelashes <br>
		Come back in the heavy rain<br>
		The world of my dreams<br>
		Will be in full bloom<br>
		Our hearts will finally reunite<br>
		Like the fall of heavy rain<br><br>

		<b>[Outro]<br>
		Anganaa phool khilenge<br>
		Anganaa phool khilenge<br><br></b>

		The flowers in the garden will bloom again<br>
		The flowers in the garden will bloom again<br><br><br><br></p></center>
